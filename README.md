Collection of my dotfiles and miscellaneous Notes on development tools
======================================================================

A collection of configuration files, links and notes on settings and plugins
for development tools. In case of the zombie apocalypse.

General
-------
* [Inconsolata](http://www.levien.com/type/myfonts/inconsolata.html) as OpenType. Some problems in WPF-based programs. Just use Consolas in Windows, it's based on that anyway.
* [Inconsolata TTF](https://code.google.com/p/googlefontdirectory/source/browse/inconsolata/Inconsolata.ttf?r=fffda675769720a297f4d239e7065f751bbe655f) Same as above in .ttf format. Doesn't really work any better :/.
* [Base16 syntax highlighting colors](https://chriskempson.github.io/base16/) Implementations for Editors in below sections.

Vim
---

* [Pathogen](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen) "Poor man's plugin manager" whatever that means.
* [Base16 Colors](https://github.com/chriskempson/base16-vim/) Includes Base16-ocean for vim.


Jetbrains Products
------------------

* [Themes](http://ideacolorthemes.org/) Collection of themes for all Jetbrains IDE's.
* [Base16-ocean](http://ideacolorthemes.org/themes/96/) The one that matters.
