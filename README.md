Collection of my personal configurations (dotfiles) and miscellaneous Notes on development tools
================================================================================================

A collection of configuration files, links and notes on settings and plugins for development tools.
In case of zombie apocalypse.

General
-------
* [Inconsolata](http://www.levien.com/type/myfonts/inconsolata.html) as OpenType. Some problems in WPF-based programs. Just use Consolas in Windows, it's based on that anyway.
* [Inconsolata TTF](https://code.google.com/p/googlefontdirectory/source/browse/inconsolata/Inconsolata.ttf?r=fffda675769720a297f4d239e7065f751bbe655f) Same as above as .ttf. Doesn't really work any better :/.

Vim
---

* [Pathogen](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen) "Poor man's pluginmanager" maybe i need a new one...? Works great though!
* [Base16 Colors](https://github.com/chriskempson/base16-vim/) Includes Base16-ocean for vim.


Jetbrains Products
------------------

Includes Intellij IDEA, WebStorm and Android Studio.

* [Themes](http://ideacolorthemes.org/home/) Collection of themes for all Jetbrains IDE's.
* [Base16-ocean](http://ideacolorthemes.org/themes/96/) The one that matters.


Git
---

* [David DeSandro](http://dropshado.ws/post/7844857440/gitconfig-colors) blog entry is a good start point.
